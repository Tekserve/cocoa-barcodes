<H1>NKDBarcodeOffscreenView</H1><hr>
<b>Abstract: </b>View subclass for rendering the barcode. This view does all of the drawing work for the framework. Barcodes
are drawn here so that we can create a resolution-independent NSImage. Were we to draw directly into an NSImage,
it would use a bitmap at screen resolution and not utilize full resolution when printed on other devices.
<br><br>
This view should not be placed on a view. Although it <i>should</i> work correctly (albeit, dictating its display size),
it is really designed to be used as an offscreen drawing area.
