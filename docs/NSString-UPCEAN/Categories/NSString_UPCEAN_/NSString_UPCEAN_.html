<H1>NSString(UPCEAN)</H1><hr>
<br><br>
This category on NSString adds the instance methods needed by the various UPC and EAN barcode classes. Both of these methods were originally part of the NKDAbstractUPCEANBarcode class, but since they operate on NSStrings and never needs to be overridden, this seems a better fit, and also makes the code more readable
