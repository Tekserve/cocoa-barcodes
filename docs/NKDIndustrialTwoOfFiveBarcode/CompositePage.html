The Industrial variant of the two of five barcode is nearly identical to the interleaved two of five, except
that the gaps are not used to encode data, only the bar widths are read. The industrial two of five is less
compact (and less common) than its interleaved cousin.

I do not have "official" specification for this barcode, and was not able to find out the correct width for the
inter-bar gap. I originally used one narrow-bar-width, which seemed to be too small, so I bumped it up to two narrow-bar-widths
which is exactly half-way between a narrow-bar (1*barWidth) and a wide-bar (3*barWidth)
