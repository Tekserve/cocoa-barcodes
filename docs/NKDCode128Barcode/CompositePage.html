<h2>Discussion</h2>
<br><br>
This concrete subclass of NKDBarcode handles one of the more complex encoding schemes - Code 128, which is
capable of encoding the entire ASCII-7 character set. It uses three "code sets" which can be switched
between by using control characters.
<br><br>
Code A allows the encoding of upper-case alphanumeric characters and non-printing characters such as ACK, and ESC,
Code B has upper and lower case alphanumerics, and Code C is encodes numeric data packed in two digits per character,
making Code 128 a very useful barcode because it both offers a complete character set AND offers a very compact encoding
scheme, especially for numeric data.

<h3><a name="CodeSet">CodeSet</a></h3>
<blockquote><pre>
typedef int CodeSet;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Defines a type of CodeSet (as an Int) to make methods that take one of the precompiler defined set values
more readable.
 </p>
<hr>
<h2>#defines</h2>
<h3><a name="SET_A">SET_A</a></h3>
<blockquote><pre>
#define SET_A 0
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Used to designate that we are using Code Set A, shifting to B or C if necessary
 </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="SET_B">SET_B</a></h3>
<blockquote><pre>
#define SET_B 1
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Used to designate that we are using Code Set B, shifting to A or C if necessary
 </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="SET_C">SET_C</a></h3>
<blockquote><pre>
#define SET_C 2
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Used to designate that we are using Code Set A. With our current algorithm, we won't be shifting to
A or B, but at some point, our initiator routine should look for situations where most (but not all)
of the characters are numbers and Set C with shifting to one of the other sets still results in a shorter
encoding, however this will involve more than just changing the algorithm to determine the primary set, since
SET_C processes two charactes at a time and this framework is primarily focused on the individual encoding of
characters. That behavior is not immutable - it is overridden in the Interleaved Two of Five class, but overriding
this behavior for part, but not all, of <i>content</i> presents several challenges.
