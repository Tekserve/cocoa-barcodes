<p>Used to designate that we are using Code Set A. With our current algorithm, we won't be shifting to
A or B, but at some point, our initiator routine should look for situations where most (but not all)
of the characters are numbers and Set C with shifting to one of the other sets still results in a shorter
encoding, however this will involve more than just changing the algorithm to determine the primary set, since
SET_C processes two charactes at a time and this framework is primarily focused on the individual encoding of
characters. That behavior is not immutable - it is overridden in the Interleaved Two of Five class, but overriding
this behavior for part, but not all, of <i>content</i> presents several challenges.
