<H1>NKDCode128Barcode.h</H1><hr>
<br><br>
This concrete subclass of NKDBarcode handles one of the more complex encoding schemes - Code 128, which is
capable of encoding the entire ASCII-7 character set. It uses three "code sets" which can be switched
between by using control characters.
<br><br>
Code A allows the encoding of upper-case alphanumeric characters and non-printing characters such as ACK, and ESC,
Code B has upper and lower case alphanumerics, and Code C is encodes numeric data packed in two digits per character,
making Code 128 a very useful barcode because it both offers a complete character set AND offers a very compact encoding
scheme, especially for numeric data.
