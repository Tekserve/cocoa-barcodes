<h2>Discussion</h2>
NKDBarcode is a quasi-abstract class that contains state and actions common to generating many
different types of barcodes. It encapsulates much of the common behavior of the concrete subclasses that
implement varoius one dimensional (linear) barcodes. Subclasses will respond to a barcode message by
returning an NSString of 1s and 0s, assuming that a value of '1' represents a bar of the narrowest size needed
by this encoding scheme, and that '0' represents a gap of the same size.
<br><br>
If a subclass modifies this behavior, it should be well documented, and NKDBarcodeOffscreenView will possibly
have to be modified to accommodate the change.
<br><br>
Although most barcode specifications allow narrow bar widths as small as 7.5 mils, I am using a default
size of 13 mils for all barcodes that don't have strict bar-width requirements in their specification (e.g. PostNet)
because this is an acceptable bar width for most barcodes and many inkjet and laser printers have insufficient resolution 
to produce a readable code on plain paper at bar widths smaller than this size.
<br><br>
The framework currently contains subclasses for Code 3 of 9, Extended Code 3 of 9, Interleaved Code
2 of 5, Modified Plessey and Modified Plessey Hex (not compliant with specs, untested), PostNet,
UPC-A, Code 128, Industrial 2 of 5, and EAN-13, Codabar, EAN-8 and UPC-E. In some cases, I do not have the complete
or official specifications. I also, unfortunately, do not have equipment to test some types of barcode, so I welcome
any help debugging, testing, and validating the encoding schemes of the provided subclasses. No guarantee is made concerning
the creation of readable code for any given hardware - I've done the best job that I could armed only with my PowerBook,
a Cue Cat and the specifications I could find.
<br><br>
If you have complete specifications or information about any dimensional linear barcodes or (for that matter) and other feedback,
please send it to me at <code>jeff_lamarche&#064;mac.com</code> and I will try to respond. Support for 2-dimensional (matrix)
barcodes is not currently planned as part of this framework, but if there's an interest, I'll consider adding it.

<p>This value is used to determine the drawing location of various bars. Though many
devices have different resolution, drawing in Cocoa seems to based on 72 pixels per inch
