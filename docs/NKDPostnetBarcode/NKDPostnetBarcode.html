<br><br>
This is a concrete subclass of NKDBarcode that implements a two of five barcode that uses the <i>height</i>
of the bars, rather than the width, to encode numeric data according to US Postal Service specifications.
<br><br>
We are using a bar width of .015" and a gap space of .030" - this spacing is within the US Postal
Service's specs and since the gap space is exactly twice the bar width, we can represent the gap
with two zeros and represent all bars as one one. The real logic for this barcode is in the barTop
method, which makes it a somewhat unusual subclass of NKDBarcode.
