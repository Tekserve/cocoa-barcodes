<br><br>
This is a concrete subclass of NKDBarcode that implements a 4 state barcode that uses
the <i>height</i> of the bars, rather than the width, to encode numeric data according to
Royal Mail specifications.  This barcode is known as the Royal Mail Four-State Customer
Code (RM4SCC) in some documentation, and as the Customer Barcode (CBC) in other documentation.
<br><br>
See documentation for Mailsort 700 for more details on this barcode format.  This barcode
format is the same as that used in the Netherlands, and similar (possibly the same) as
the format used on Australian mail.
