<H1>NKDInterleavedTwoOfFiveBarcode</H1><hr>
<b>Abstract: </b>Two of Five barcode that uses both bars and gaps to encode numeric data
<hr><br>
Interleaved 2 of 5 uses Wide and Narrow bars interleaved (digits 1 and 2 occupy the same
space, one is bars, the other by the spaces. Therefore, we won't be using _encodeChar - we'll
override the barcode method to use a class-specific method called _getBarForDigit:forBarNumber
<br><br>
Because of the interleaving, there must be an even number of characters; With the check-digit, odd
length values become even and even-length become odd. Odd numbers (even when check-digit used)
are zero-padded to make an even-length value.
